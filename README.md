## 💡 How to Submit a Ticket/Feedback

To process your feedback more efficiently, please make sure to use the **Issue Templates** we provide when creating a new ticket.

1.  Click the **[New issue]** button in the upper right corner.
2.  Select the template that fits your feedback type:
    * **🐞 Bug Report:** Use this when you discover a product feature that is not working or behaving abnormally.
    * **✨ Feature Request:** Use this when you wish to suggest adding a new feature or improving an existing one.
3.  **Please ensure all necessary information in the template is filled out** (e.g., reproduction steps, environment details, expected results, etc.). The more detailed the information, the faster we can resolve the issue.

## ⚙️ Processing Flow and Notes

* **Ticket Status:** You can check the status of your ticket and the latest replies from the development team in the Issue list.
* **Duplicate Tickets:** Before submitting, please search to see if a similar Issue already exists. If it does, please comment on the existing Issue to add more information, avoiding the creation of duplicate tickets.
* **Discussion:** Please maintain friendly and professional communication. For discussions unrelated to support tickets, we may close the issue or mark it as "irrelevant."
* **Response Time:** We will review and process all submitted tickets as quickly as possible. However, please understand that processing time may vary depending on the complexity and priority of the issue.
